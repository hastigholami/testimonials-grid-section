          <br>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned 
          <br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
          <br>I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          <br>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          <br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for    
          <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 
          <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve 
          <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

      <br>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve 
      <br>never written a line of code. I needed 
      <br>some structure from professionals 
      <br>who can help me learn programming 
      <br>step by step. I was encouraged to 
      <br>enroll by a former student of theirs 
      <br>who can only say wonderful things 
      <br>about the program. The entire 
      <br>curriculum and staff did not 
      <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on 
      <br>and I never had to wait long for 
      <br>assistance. The agile team project, in 
      <br>particular, was outstanding. It took 
      <br>my learning to the next level in a way 
      <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In 
      <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during 
      <br>interviews as an example of my 
      <br>developent experience. It certainly 
      <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack 
      <br>developer after receiving multiple 
      <br>offers. 100% recommend! ”
